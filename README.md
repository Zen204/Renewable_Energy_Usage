# Renewable Energy in Comparison with Electricity Access and GDP per Capita, COSI 116A F24

Welcome to the repository for our final project for COSI 116A: Introduction to Information Visualization at Brandeis University (Fall 2024). This project showcases our team's efforts in designing and implementing an interactive and insightful data visualization tool.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on leveraging data visualization techniques to provide meaningful insights into our chosen dataset. The tool is hosted and can be accessed via the following link:

[Project Website](https://cosi116a-brandeis-infovis-fall23.github.io/cosi-116a-f24-final-project-repository/)

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Engaging and intuitive user interfaces to explore the data.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Allow users to focus on specific subsets of the data.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible across devices and screen sizes.
- **Insights and Annotations**: Highlight key findings from the data.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For building the web-based visualization interface.
- **D3.js**: For creating interactive visualizations.
- **Chart.js/Plotly/Other Libraries**: (Optional, depending on the project tools used).
- **GitHub Pages**: For hosting the project website.
